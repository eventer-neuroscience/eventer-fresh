## Experimental Methodology:
### Preparation
Dissociated cell culture
### Recording Temperature (celsius)
32
### Intracellular Solution
A standard pipette solution was used in all experiments containing (in mM); 10 NaCl, 11 HEPES, 117 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2 2 Na2-ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 Na-GTP (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.2 Na2-phosphocreatine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 11 EGTA (Fisher); pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH.
### Extracellular Solution
Recordings were made on neurons in extracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 135 NaCl (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK); 5 KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK); 5 HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 D-Glucose (Fisher Scientific); 1.2 MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich); 1.25 CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich); pH adjusted to 7.4
